Project aiming to migrate existing sectools checking scripts
to SCE (Script Check Engine) for use with XCCDF and related technologies

== ./script_tester.py ==
A helper script that allows you to test migrated scripts without having all
of the machinery in place.

Usage:
./script_tester.py some_script
./script_tester.py *.sh *.py
etc..

== ./script_aggregator.py ==
Dirty script that generates an XCCDF referencing all given scripts as SCE checks.

Usage:
./script_aggregator.py some_script > result.xccdf
./script_aggregator.py *.sh *.py *.pl > result.xccdf
etc..
