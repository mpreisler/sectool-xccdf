Project aiming to migrate existing sectools checking scripts
to SCE (Script Check Engine) for use with XCCDF and related technologies

== ./script_tester.py ==
A helper script that allows you to test migrated scripts without having all
of the machinery in place.

Usage:
./script_tester.py some_script
./script_tester.py *.sh *.py
etc..

TODO:
Make an aggregator script that will create XCCDF using lines from
the scripts for title and description.
